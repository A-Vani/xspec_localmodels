Setting chatter to 20 and computing the model (eg running fit) causes
it to dump "squared densities" and "emission measures."  The squared
densities apply to the inner edge of each shell and they are in units
of the squared density at the inner edge of the innermost shell.

The "Emission measures" are 
$$ E_{i,j} = \int_{V_{i,j}} {n_e / n_{e,0}}^2 dV / (4 \pi), $$
where $V_{ij}$ is the intersection between the $i$th shell and the
$j$th cylinder, and $n_{e,0}$ is the density at the inner edge of the
innermost shell.  Distances in these integrals are in units of pixels
(whatever value is used in the XFLT keywords).  Beware of the factor
of $4 \pi$ that is omitted from the emission measure integrals (see
Atmosphere::tpinteg).

The one free norm, $N$, for the thermal models is the XSPEC norm for the
whole of the innermost volume, $V_{0,0}$.  To compute the density at
the inner edge of the innermost shell, note that
$$ N = n_{e,0} n_{H,0} 10^{-14} s^3 d_A E_{0,0} (1 + z)^{-2}, $$
where $s$ is the pixel size in radians, $d_A$ is the angular diameter
distance and $z$ is the redshift.
